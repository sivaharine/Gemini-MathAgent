🏷️ Project Title: Gemini Math Agent – Zero-Shot Reasoning with LangChain
📖 Description:

This project demonstrates how to build an AI-powered reasoning agent using LangChain and Google’s Gemini (Generative AI) model.
The agent is initialized with mathematical reasoning tools (llm-math) and performs zero-shot problem-solving, meaning it can handle queries without prior examples or training data.
Environment variables are managed securely with dotenv, and the system provides a practical example of tool-augmented LLM reasoning for computation-based tasks.

⚙️ Features:

🤖 Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash for high-speed responses

🧮 Performs real-time math and logical reasoning using LangChain tools

🧠 Implements zero-shot-react-description agent type

🔐 Loads API keys securely using .env

💬 Provides structured reasoning for user queries

🚀 Outcome:

Built a functional LangChain agent capable of performing accurate, reasoning-based computations powered by Google’s Gemini model.
